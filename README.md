# AI-TO-NON-AI
Here's a **README** file content for your Python script that processes text to make it more "anti-AI-detectable" by replacing words with synonyms and correcting grammar:

# 🧠 AI-Evading Text Processor

This Python script reads text from a file, replaces words with their synonyms (while avoiding common stopwords), and corrects grammar using LanguageTool. The goal is to rephrase content in a human-like way that could help in making it less detectable by AI detectors or for paraphrasing and content enhancement purposes.

## 🚀 Features

* 🔄 **Synonym Replacement** using WordNet
* 📝 **Grammar Correction** using LanguageTool
* 🛑 **Stopword Protection** – common English stopwords are not modified
* 📖 **Encoding Detection** with `chardet`
* 📂 **File-based Input/Output**

---

## 📦 Requirements

Install the dependencies:

```bash
pip install nltk language-tool-python chardet
```

Download required NLTK data:

```python
import nltk
nltk.download('punkt')
nltk.download('wordnet')
nltk.download('averaged_perceptron_tagger')
nltk.download('stopwords')
```

## 🧩 How It Works

1. **Input Text** – Reads from a `.txt` file.
2. **Tokenization** – Breaks text into words.
3. **Synonym Replacement** – Replaces each non-stopword with a randomly chosen synonym using WordNet.
4. **Grammar Check** – Uses `language_tool_python` to correct grammar.
5. **Save Output** – Writes the processed text to a new file.

## 📁 File Structure

```
.
├── ai_text_processor.py         # <--- Your main script
├── What is data mining.txt      # <--- Input file (example)
└── What is data mining_processed.txt  # <--- Output file (auto-generated)
```

---

## ▶️ Usage

Run the script:

```bash
python ai_text_processor.py
```

Make sure to update the `input_file_path` in the script if your file has a different name.

---

## ✍️ Notes

* Grammar correction uses an online check via LanguageTool; make sure you're connected to the internet.
* Word replacement is random, so results vary each time you run the script.
* For larger texts, this process may take time.
